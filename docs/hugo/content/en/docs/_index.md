DPsim is a solver library for dynamic power system simulation.

- It supports both the electromagnetic transient (EMT) and dynamic phasor (DP) domain for dynamic simulation.
- A powerflow solver is included for standalone usage or to initialize dynamic simulations.
- It provides a Python module which can be embedded in any Python 3 application / scripts.
- The simulation core is implemented in highly-efficient C++ code.
- It supports real-time execution with time-steps down to 50 uS.
- It can load models in the IEC61970 Common Information Model (CIM) / Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) XML format.
- It can be interfaced to a variety of protocols and interfaces via [VILLASnode](https://fein-aachen.org/projects/villas-node/).
